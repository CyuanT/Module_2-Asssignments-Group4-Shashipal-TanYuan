### Brief

Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to gain a deeper understanding of AWS permissions and policies and how they can be used to secure access to AWS resources.

Instructions:

Choose one of the two below:

Option 1: Research
- Research and investigate the concepts of AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) and the different types of permissions and policies available.
- Write a report summarizing your experience with IAM, including an overview of the permissions and policies used, any challenges encountered, and any benefits or limitations observed.
- Provide examples of how these permissions and policies can be used in a real-world scenario.


Option 2: Hands On
- Create a new IAM user with the syntax YOUR NAME + "-temp-user" suffix e.g. luqman-temp-user.
- Grant this new user you have created access to (i) create, view and delete EC2 instances, (ii) create and view S3 buckets only and (iii) view RDS instances only.
- Test out the permissions of your new user to verify that the user can only perform the above actions.
- Share the IAM user with us in NTU blackboard for us to verify.

Deliverables:

- A sample AWS environment that demonstrates the use of AWS IAM permissions and policies
- A report summarizing your experience with IAM.
