## Assignment

### Brief

The objective of this assignment is to gain a deeper understanding of cloud computing, hybrid computing and traditional computing and the benefits and limitations of each.

1. Research the different types of computing models, including cloud computing, hybrid computing, and traditional computing.
2. Choose a specific use case (e.g. a small business, a startup, a large enterprise) and determine which computing model would be the most appropriate for that use case, providing a detailed explanation of your reasoning.
3. Compare and contrast the benefits and limitations of each model, including cost, scalability, security, and flexibility.
4. Write a report summarizing your research, including a comparison and contrast of the different computing models and an analysis of the chosen use case.

Presentation with your own group about which method that will you use to handle these case

Case:

- Newly Launched eCommerce
- Large eCommerce with millions of user
- Financial Institution
- Government
- Personal Static Website
- Email Application


Method:

- Traditional Computing
- Cloud Computing
- Hybrid Cloud Computing


Note:

Be sure to consider the most recent advancements in each model.

### Submission 
======== Start =========

Use case: Newly launched eCommerce

#### Point 2
The following point justifications to using cloud computing:
- As a startup, the business might flop, any investment into IT infrastructure at this stage would be a risk.
- Footprint: Setting up an IT infratructure will take up a large footprint/Space which can be limited for a startup.
- Scalability: Assuming that the business have a sudden influx of traffic into our hosted site, having deploying our system in cloud will allow us to scale according to demand. Deploying an Op-prem system will limited our processing capabilities 
- Maintenance: On-prem system will require a higher degress of maintenance as compared to cloud systems. Different component on-prem can be replaced by cloud service that are maintained by the service providers.
- Cost: With higher maintenance requirement, on-prem system will also more skilled IT personnel to manage. 


#### Point 3
Feature | On-prem Computing | Cloud Computing | Hybrid Cloud Computing
--- | ---| --- | ---
Ownership | Self | Public | Self & Public
Accessibilty | Solely Owned Resource | Shared Resource | Combination depends on design
Cost | High | Pay-as-you-go | Cost-optimization
Scalability |	Limited to physical hardware, slow and costly to scale | Highly scalable, can scale up or down quickly based on demand | Flexible, can scale in the cloud while maintaining critical systems on-premises
Maintenance	| Requires in-house IT team for maintenance and upgrades | Maintenance handled by cloud provider | Requires maintenance for on-premises components, cloud components maintained by provider
Disaster Recovery	| Requires significant investment in backup infrastructure | Built-in disaster recovery solutions. geo-redundancy | Combines on-premises backups with cloud-based disaster recovery solutions
Footprint | High Footprint | No footprint | Dependent on design


======== End =========


- Submit the URL of the GitHub Repository that contains your work to NTU black board.
- Should you reference the work of your classmate(s) or online resources, give them credit by adding either the name of your classmate or URL.
