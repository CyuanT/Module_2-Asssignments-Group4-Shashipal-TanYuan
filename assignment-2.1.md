## Assignment

### Brief

The objective of this assignment is to gain a deeper understanding of cloud computing, hybrid computing and traditional computing and the benefits and limitations of each.

1. Research the different types of computing models, including cloud computing, hybrid computing, and traditional computing.
2. Choose a specific use case (e.g. a small business, a startup, a large enterprise) and determine which computing model would be the most appropriate for that use case, providing a detailed explanation of your reasoning.
3. Compare and contrast the benefits and limitations of each model, including cost, scalability, security, and flexibility.
4. Write a report summarizing your research, including a comparison and contrast of the different computing models and an analysis of the chosen use case.

Presentation with your own group about which method that will you use to handle these case

Case:

- Newly Launched eCommerce
- Large eCommerce with millions of user
- Financial Institution
- Government
- Personal Static Website
- Email Application


Method:

- Traditional Computing
- Cloud Computing
- Hybrid Cloud Computing


Note:

Be sure to consider the most recent advancements in each model.
