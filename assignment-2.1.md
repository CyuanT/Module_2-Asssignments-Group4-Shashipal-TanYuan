## Assignment

### Brief

The objective of this assignment is to gain a deeper understanding of cloud computing, hybrid computing and traditional computing and the benefits and limitations of each.

1. Research the different types of computing models, including cloud computing, hybrid computing, and traditional computing.
2. Choose a specific use case (e.g. a small business, a startup, a large enterprise) and determine which computing model would be the most appropriate for that use case, providing a detailed explanation of your reasoning.
3. Compare and contrast the benefits and limitations of each model, including cost, scalability, security, and flexibility.
4. Write a report summarizing your research, including a comparison and contrast of the different computing models and an analysis of the chosen use case.

Presentation with your own group about which method that will you use to handle these case

Case:

- Newly Launched eCommerce
- Large eCommerce with millions of user
- Financial Institution
- Government
- Personal Static Website
- Email Application


Method:

- Traditional Computing
- Cloud Computing
- Hybrid Cloud Computing


Note:

Be sure to consider the most recent advancements in each model.

### Submission 
======== Start =========
Use case: Newly launched eCommerce

Feature | On-prem Computing | Cloud Computing | Hybrid Cloud Computing
--- | ---| --- | ---
Ownership | Self | Public | Self & Public
Accessibilty | Solely Owned Resource | Shared Resource | Combination depends on design
Cost | High | Pay-as-you-go | Cost-optimization
Scalability |	Limited to physical hardware, slow and costly to scale | Highly scalable, can scale up or down quickly based on demand | Flexible, can scale in the cloud while maintaining critical systems on-premises
Maintenance	| Requires in-house IT team for maintenance and upgrades | Maintenance handled by cloud provider | Requires maintenance for on-premises components, cloud components maintained by provider
Disaster Recovery	| Requires significant investment in backup infrastructure | Built-in disaster recovery solutions. geo-redundancy | Combines on-premises backups with cloud-based disaster recovery solutions
Footprint | High Footprint | No footprint | Dependent on design
Innovation | Slower adoption of new technologies due to hardware constraints	| Access to the latest technologies and services | Can innovate using cloud services while maintaining critical on-premises systems
Latency	| Low latency |	May experience higher latency due to network distance |	Can optimize latency by using local resources for critical tasks and cloud for others
Deployment Speed | Slow, due to procurement and setup time | Fast, quick provisioning of resources | New deployments can be fast in the cloud, but on-premises setups remain slower
Vendor Lock-in | Systems are in-house, but dependent on specific hardware/software vendors | Potential for lock-in with cloud providers, can be mitigated by multi-cloud strategies |	Possible risk of lock-in, but can be minimized by using standardised interfaces and multi-cloud
