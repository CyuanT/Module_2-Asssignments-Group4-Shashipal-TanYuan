## Assignment

### Brief

Group Assignment.

- Discuss within your group about what is the project (e.g. banking application, e-commerce application etc.) that you will run.
- Discuss withn your group about what methodology (e.g. Agile or waterfall or a hybrid) that you will use to run that project and why
- When it comes to deployment, what kind of software deployment methodologies (e.g. Blue-Green, Rolling etc.) would you use and why
- Discuss what CI/CD Pipeline tools (AWS or third-party tools) that you will use.

### Submission 

================== START =======================
# E-Commerce Application Project Summary

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Develop a user-friendly e-commerce platform to facilitate online shopping.
- **Key Features**: Product catalog, shopping cart, payment gateway integration, user accounts, order tracking, and reviews.

## Project Methodology: Agile

### Pros of Agile

- **Flexibility**: Adapts to changing requirements and priorities.
- **Customer Collaboration**: Regular feedback from stakeholders ensures alignment with user needs.
- **Incremental Progress**: Delivers working software in iterative cycles, allowing early detection of issues.
- **Improved Quality**: Continuous testing and integration lead to better product quality.

### Cons of Agile

- **Scope Creep**: Frequent changes can lead to scope creep if not managed properly.
- **Resource Intensive**: Requires active involvement from all team members and stakeholders.
- **Time Consuming**: Iterative development can be time-consuming and may extend project timelines.

## Deployment Methodology: Rolling Deployment

### Pros of Rolling Deployment

- **Minimized Downtime**: Updates are deployed gradually, reducing the risk of downtime.
- **Controlled Rollout**: Allows for monitoring and addressing issues in stages.
- **User Impact**: Users experience minimal disruption as updates are applied incrementally.

### Cons of Rolling Deployment

- **Complexity**: Requires careful management to ensure consistent performance across different stages.
- **Rollback Challenges**: Reverting changes can be complex if issues are detected late in the deployment process.

## CI/CD Pipeline Tools

### AWS CodePipeline

- **Pros**:
  - Fully integrated with AWS services.
  - Supports automation of the entire release process.
  - Scalable and secure.
- **Cons**:
  - Can be complex for users unfamiliar with AWS ecosystem.
  - Cost can escalate with large-scale deployments.

### Jenkins

- **Pros**:
  - Open-source and highly customizable.
  - Large plugin ecosystem supports various integrations.
  - Widely used and well-supported community.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires ongoing maintenance and configuration.
  - Can be resource-intensive to manage and scale.

### GitLab CI/CD

- **Pros**:
  - Integrated with GitLab for seamless version control and CI/CD.
  - Offers built-in features for deployment, monitoring, and security.
  - Easy to set up and use.
- **Cons**:
  - Some advanced features may require a paid subscription.
  - Limited support for non-GitLab repositories.
