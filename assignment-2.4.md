```
- Choose a specific use case (e.g. web application development, big data processing, machine learning) and determine which type of service (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS) would be the most appropriate for that use case, providing a detailed explanation of your reasoning.
- Create a sample project that demonstrates the use of one of the services (IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS) and compare it with the other services.
